Configuring SNMPv3 on Synology NAS

In order to allow the Zabbix Server to monitor your NAS, we need to enable SNMPv3 on it.

After logging in into your NAS, navigate to Control Panel >> Terminal & SNMP and select the tab SNMP. Make sure SNMPv3 is enabled as follows::

Enable SNMP service
SNMPv1, SNMPv2c service: unchecked
SNMPv3 service: checked
Username: zabbix
Protocol: SHA
Password: Pick one password
Enable SNMP privacy: checked
Protocol: AES
Password: Pick one password
SNMP Device Information
Device name: Synology hostname
Device location: Device location or leave empty
Contact: Contact information or leave empty
Click on Apply and you are done.

Configuring Zabbix Server through Web UI

The template we are going to use doesn’t come installed in Zabbix Server by default, so we are going to import it first. Visit the community template page and navigate to Storage_Devices >> Synology >> template_synology_diskstation_snmpv3 >> 6.0 and click on
template_synology_diskstation_snmpv3.yaml file, followed a click on Raw button. Save the file locally.

Go to Configuration >> Templates and click on Import. Click on Choose file in the configuration dialog, select the YAML file previously saved and click on Import. Another dialog will be displayed with the actual content being imported. Click on Import .

Although we don’t need to install a Zabbix Agent on the Synology, we still need to create a Host on Zabbix Server to specify the NAS address, etc

Go to Configuration >> Templates and click on Create Host button. When the configuration dialog open, the Host tab should be the default one. Fill in the following fields and leave the rest as-is:

Host
Host name: Type the Synology hostname
Templates: Synology DiskStation SNMPv3
Host Groups: Agentless or whatever describes your Agent
Interfaces:
Add a new interface
